        <p>
          Smith River has pristine emerald waters and abundance of Chinook
          salmon and Steelhead fishing opportunities. It runs right next to
          Jedediah Redwoods State park which has some of the largest and tallest
          trees in the world. It is also a short drive from Crescent City, and
          the ocean.

      <h1>Personas</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Hardcore Fishermen:</h2>
          <p>
            Rich, retired old men that are looking for guide services to catch
            Steelhead or Salmon on the Smith River. The influx of these type of
            visitors generally peaks in early spring, and again in late fall.
            They typically stay in a local cabin, and spend money at local
            tackle shops, guide services, restruants, gas stations, bars and
            liquor stores.

        <li>
          <h2>Family Travelers:</h2>
          <p>
            Families on vacation come year round to explore the beautiful
            scenery and park opportunities in the Jedediah Redwoods. In the
            summer months, many of these type of visitors bring RV's, and pay to
            stay at local camp sites. Others stay at local hotels, cabins,
            Ainbnb's and condos. Guided rafting, zipline, and other excursions
            are typically a part of family travelers plans.

      <h1>Scenarios</h1>

          <h2>Scenario 1:</h2>
          <p>
            A family living in Idaho is planning a trip to visit the Redwoods.
            They see that the closest Redwood forest is Jedediah Smith, so they
            start to look for what type of activities the area has to offer. At
            first glance, the area doesn't appear to have many activities for
            people other than hiking. Then they come accross our website, which
            has links to all the unique and interesting local shops, excursions,
            community events, housing/hotel options, and general information
            that gets them to decide to come here rather than going to the
            redwoods in a more developed area. They sign up for a zipline trip,
            and stay at one of our cabins in the shop-town located at the mouth
            of the canyon. They enjoy eating at the local restraunts, and the
            parents go to the bar in the evening while the kids are exploring by
            the river. One of the days they visit a local farmers market and buy
            suveneirs.

        <li>
          <h2>Scenario 2:</h2>
          <p>
            A group of coworkers is trying to plan a Steelhead fishing trip in
            January. They come across our site which has enticing pictures and
            information about the great fishing opportunities and guide services
            that are found here locally. They also see an advertizement for the
            January Steelhead season that includes a group housing deal at a
            condo with a discount for scheduling in advance. They link to that
            website, and come back to the main one to plan out the rest of the
            events they want to fill their trip with between fishing runs.
