        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
          <a href="#">stackoverflow.com</a>
          <img
            src="images/stackoverflow.com.jpg"
            alt="screenshot of stackoverflow.com"
          />
          <p>
            This mobile site exemplifies the alignment principle. Everything is
            centered nicely. The layout of the page navigation is simple, and
            there are minimal buttons crowding the screen. The page information
            is seperated into equal sections making it easier to understand and
            see. Nothing is cut off the screen or crowding other elements.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Steam</h4>
          <a href="#">store.steampowered.com</a>
          <img
            src="images/store.steampowered.jpg"
            alt="screenshot of store.steampowered.com"
          />
          <p>
            I think this page displays visual hierarchy because it's pretty
            obvious what they want you to click on. The text inside the image
            links is much larger than anything else. The search is a little bit
            larger than the menu items, and that's probably because they know
            when people search for a game they are more likely to purchase
            something.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Epic Games</h4>
          <a href="#">store.epicgames.com</a>
          <img
            src="images/store.epicgames.com.jpg"
            alt="screenshot of store.epicgames.com"
          />
          <p>
            I really like the way they have these image boxes that you can swipe
            through one at a time, it really cleans up the page. There is plenty
            of space, and that makes you want to scroll and see what's below.
            Nothing is too crowded, or hard to read. The nav bar and search
            button are also really spaced out and easy to click.
